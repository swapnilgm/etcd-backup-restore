## Getting started

Currently there are no binary build available, but it is pretty straight forward to build it by following the steps mentioned below.

### Prerequisites

Although the following installation instructions are for Mac OS X, similar alternate commands could be found for any Linux distribution

#### Installing [Golang](https://golang.org/) environment

Install the latest version of Golang (at least `v1.9.4` is required). For Mac OS, you could use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```sh
brew install golang
```

For other OS, please check [Go installation documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install).

Make sure to set your `$GOPATH` environment variable properly (conventionally, it points to `$HOME/go`).

For your convenience, you can add the `bin` directory of the `$GOPATH` to your `$PATH`: `PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin`, but it is not necessarily required.

We use [Dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) for managing golang package dependencies. Please install it
on Mac OS via

```sh
brew install dep
```

On other operating systems, please check the [Dep installation documentation](https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/installation.html) and the [Dep releases page](https://github.com/golang/dep/releases). After downloading the appropriate release in your `$GOPATH/bin` folder, you need to make it executable via `chmod +x <dep-release>` and rename it to dep via `mv dep-<release> dep`.

#### [Golint](https://github.com/golang/lint)

In order to perform linting on the Go source code, please install [Golint](https://github.com/golang/lint):

```bash
go get -u github.com/golang/lint/golint
```

#### [Ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) and [Gomega](https://onsi.github.io/gomega/)

In order to perform tests on the Go source code, please install [Ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) and [Gomega](http://onsi.github.io/gomega/). Please make yourself familiar with both frameworks and read their introductions after installation:

```bash
go get -u github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo
go get -u github.com/onsi/gomega
```

#### Installing `git`

We use `git` as VCS which you would need to install.

On Mac OS run

```sh
brew install git
```

#### Installing `gcloud` SDK (Optional)

In case you have to create a new release or a new hotfix, you have to push the resulting Docker image into a Docker registry. Currently, we are using the Google Container Registry (this could change in the future). Please follow the official [installation instructions from Google](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads).

### Installing `Docker` (Optional)

In case you want to build Docker images, you have to install Docker itself. We recommend using [Docker for Mac OS X](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) which can be downloaded from [here](https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg).

### Build

First, you need to create a target folder structure before cloning and building `etcdbrctl`.

```sh

mkdir -p ~/go/src/github.com/gardener
cd ~/go/src/github.com/gardener
git clone https://github.com/gardener/etcd-backup-restore.git
cd etcd-backup-restore
```

To build the binary in local machine environment, use `make` target `build-local`.

```sh
make build-local
```

This will build the binary `etcdbrctl` under `bin` directory.

Next you can make it available to use as shell command by moving the executable to `/usr/local/bin`.

## Design

Please find the design doc [here](doc/design.md).

## Usage

You can follow the `help` flag on `etcdbrctl` command and its sub-commands to know the usage details. Some of the common use cases are mentioned below. Although examples below uses AWS S3 as storage provider, we have added support for AWS, GCS, Azure and Openstack swift object store. It also supports local disk as storage provider.

### Cloud Provider Credentials

The procedure to provide credentials to access the cloud provider object store varies for different providers.

For `AWS S3`, the `credentials` file has to be provided in the `~/.aws` directory.

For `GCP Containers`, the service account json file should be provided in the `~/.gcp` as a `service-account-file.json` file.

For `Azure Blob storage`, `STORAGE_ACCOUNT` and `STORAGE_KEY` should be made available as environment variables.

For `Openstack Swift`, `OS_USERNAME`, `OS_PASSWORD`, `OS_AUTH_URL`, `OS_TENANT_ID` and `OS_DOMAIN_ID` should be made available as environment variables.

### Taking scheduled snapshot



`etcd` should already be running. One can apply standard cron format scheduling for regular backup of etcd. The cron schedule is used to take full backups. The delta snapshots are taken at regular intervals in the period in between full snapshots as indicated by the `delta-snapshot-period-seconds` flag. The default for the same is 10 seconds.

etcd-backup-restore has two garbage collection policies to collect existing backups from the cloud bucket. The flag `garbage-collection-policy` is used to indicate the correct garbage collection policy.
1. `Exponential`
1. `LimitBased`

If using `LimitBased` policy, the `max-backups` flag should be provided to indicate the number of recent backups to persist at each garbage collection cycle.

```sh
$ ./bin/etcdbrctl snapshot --storage-provider="S3" --etcd-endpoints http://localhost:2379 --schedule "*/1 * * * *" --store-container="etcd-backup" --delta-snapshot-period-seconds=10 --max-backups=10 --garbage-collection-policy='LimitBased'
INFO[0000] Validating schedule...
INFO[0000] Job attempt: 1
INFO[0000] Taking initial full snapshot at time: 2018-07-09 12:09:04.3567024 +0000 UTC
INFO[0000] Successfully opened snapshot reader on etcd
INFO[0000] Successfully saved full snapshot at: Backup-1531138145/Full-00000000-00000001-1531138145
INFO[0000] Will take next full snapshot at time: 2018-07-09 12:10:00 +0000 UTC
INFO[0000] Applied watch on etcd from revision: 00000002
INFO[0000] No events received to save snapshot.
```

The command mentioned above takes hourly snapshots and pushs it to S3 bucket named "etcd-backup". It is configured to keep only last 10 backups in bucket.

`Exponential` policy stores the snapshots in a condensed manner as mentioned below:
- All full backups and delta backups for the previous hour.
- Latest full snapshot of each previous hour for the day.
- Latest full snapshot of each previous day for 7 days.
- Latest full snapshot of the previous 4 weeks.

```sh
$ ./bin/etcdbrctl snapshot --storage-provider="S3" --etcd-endpoints http://localhost:2379 --schedule "*/1 * * * *" --store-container="etcd-backup" --delta-snapshot-period-seconds=10 --garbage-collection-policy='Exponential'
INFO[0000] Validating schedule...
INFO[0000] Job attempt: 1
INFO[0000] Taking initial full snapshot at time: 2018-07-09 12:09:04.3567024 +0000 UTC
INFO[0000] Successfully opened snapshot reader on etcd
INFO[0000] Successfully saved full snapshot at: Backup-1531138145/Full-00000000-00000001-1531138145

INFO[0000] Applied watch on etcd from revision: 00000002
INFO[0000] No events received to save snapshot.
```

The command mentioned above stores etcd snapshots as per the exponential policy mentioned above.

### Etcd data directory initialization

Sub-command `initialize` does the task of data directory validation. If the data directory is found to be corrupt, the controller will restore it from the latest snapshot in the cloud store. It restores the full snapshot first and then incrementally applies the delta snapshots.

```sh
$ ./bin/etcdbrctl initialize --storage-provider="S3" --store-container="etcd-backup" --data-dir="default.etcd"
INFO[0000] Checking for data directory structure validity...
INFO[0000] Checking for data directory files corruption...

INFO[0000] Successfully restored the etcd data directory.
```

### Etcdbrctl server

With sub-command `server` you can start a http server which exposes an endpoint to initialize etcd over REST interface. The server also keeps on backup schedule thread running to have periodic backups. This is mainly made available to manage an etcd instance running in a Kubernetes cluster. You can deploy the example [manifest](./example/etcd-statefulset.yaml) on a Kubernetes cluster to have an fault resilient etcd instance.

## Dependency management

We use [Dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) to manage golang dependencies.. In order to add a new package dependency to the project, you can perform `dep ensure -add <PACKAGE>` or edit the `Gopkg.toml` file and append the package along with the version you want to use as a new `[[constraint]]`.

### Updating dependencies

The `Makefile` contains a rule called `revendor` which performs a `dep ensure -update` and a `dep prune` command. This updates all the dependencies to its latest versions (respecting the constraints specified in the `Gopkg.toml` file). The command also installs the packages which do not already exist in the `vendor` folder but are specified in the `Gopkg.toml` (in case you have added new ones).

```sh
make revendor
```

The dependencies are installed into the `vendor` folder which **should be added** to the VCS.

:warning: Make sure you test the code after you have updated the dependencies!

## Testing

We have created `make` target `verify` which will internally run different rule like `fmt` for formatting, `lint` for linting check and most importantly `test` which will check the code against predefined unit tests. Although, currently there are not enough test cases written to cover entire code, hence one should check for failure cases manually before raising pull request. We will eventually add the test cases for complete code coverage.

```sh
make verify
```

By default, we try to run test in parallel without computing code coverage. To get the code coverage, you will have to set environment variable `COVER` to `true`. This will log the code coverage percentage at the end of test logs. Also, all cover profile files will accumulated under `test/output/coverprofile.out` directory. You can visualize exact code coverage using `make show-coverage`.
